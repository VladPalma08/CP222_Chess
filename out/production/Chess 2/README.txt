Welcome to Team Chess' Chess Game. We make up the team:
Grace Mun, Caleb Peimann, Vladimir Palma

To be able to run our game, ensure you have all of our classes downloaded on your local device.
Afterwards, navigate to the "Main" class and run the main method. You will be prompted to a menu screen.

From there, feel free to explore your options! There are buttons that will help you navigate
throughout our program. When in game, there are three additional buttons on the top left of the interface:

Menu: Returns you back to the Main Menu screen
New Game: Resets the board for a new session
Exit: Terminate the application

Our program functions like a standard game of Chess, following the same movement patterns and
rules (outside of possible bugs you may encounter).

Team Chess hopes you enjoy what experiences and "easter eggs" you may encounter!
